Aldous-Broder Maze Generator
=============================

A simple maze generator generating a 10x10 grid maze using the Aldous-Broder algorithm.<br>
This algorithm is comically inefficient, due to the iterator choosing random paths to draw the maze at all times.
This often leads to situatios, where it takes several minutes for the iterator to bump into the final cell.

The algorithm is described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
